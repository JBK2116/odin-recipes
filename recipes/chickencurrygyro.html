        <h3><u>Ingredients</u></h3>
        <p>For the chicken marinade:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>500g chicken thighs</li>
                <li>200g plain yoghurt (full fat is best)</li>
                <li>1 tbsp. curry powder</li>
                <li>1 tsp. sweet paprika</li>
                <li>1 tsp. garam masala</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>Juice of &frac12; a lemon</li>
            </ul>
        <p>For the mint-yoghurt sauce:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 green chilli (deseeded & chopped)</li>
                <li>1 handful mint (stalks removed)</li>
                <li>1 handful coriander (stalks removed)</li>
                <li>1 tsp. extra virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>200g plain yoghurt</li>
                <li>1 garlic clove (minced)</li>
                <li>¼ tsp. cumin</li>
                <li>¼ tsp. garam masala</li>
                <li>A small squeeze of lemon juice</li>
            </ul>
        <h3><u>How To Prepare</u></h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix together the marinade ingredients until fully combined, then add your chicken thighs and coat. Cover and leave to marinate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, add the green chilli, coriander, mint leaves, olive oil and a splash of water to a food processor or blender and blitz until smooth. Add this mixture to a bowl with plain yoghurt, garlic, cumin, garam masala, and lemon juice and mix well to combine.</li>
                <li>When you’re ready to cook the chicken thighs, remove from fridge 10 minutes before cooking to allow them to slowly come to room temp. Then heat a non-stick pan or cast iron skillet, add chicken thighs, and cook for around 5 minutes on each side. Make sure they are cooked through before removing and set aside.</li>
                <li>Add peppers into the pan, skin side down, and cook until they’re slightly soft and charred.</li>
                <li>Slice your chicken thighs into thin strips. Make sure the rest of your garnishes are ready to serve and then build your gyros. First, add a generous amount of mint-yoghurt sauce to the base of your flatbread, then pile on the chicken, pepper, red onion slices, and tomatoes. Top with mango chutney and coriander — then tuck in to a truly epic fakeaway.</li>
            </ol>
