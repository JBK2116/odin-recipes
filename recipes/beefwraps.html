                <li>500g 5% fat beef mince</li>
                <li>1 red onion (finely chopped)</li>
                <li>1 pack of taco seasoning</li>
                <li>50g light cheddar (grated)</li>
                <li>100g mozzarella (grated)</li>
                <li>5 tbsp. salsa</li>
                <li>100g soured cream</li>
                <li>Jalapeños (chopped)</li>
                <li>Tomato slices</li>
                <li>Lettuce</li>
                <li>5 tortilla wraps</li>
            </ul>
        <h3><u>How To Prepare</u></h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 200°C/ 400°F.</li>
                <li>Heat the coconut oil in a non-stick pan and add your beef mince. Cook for 5 minutes until brown, then add the onion and continue to cook for 3-4 minutes until onions are soft.</li>
                <li>Add the taco seasoning, stir through and cook for another 5 minutes before removing from heat.</li>
                <li>
                    To build your crunch wrap, add 2-3 tablespoons of beef mince filling to the centre of your tortilla, 
                    then cheddar and mozzarella on top, followed by salsa, jalapeños, soured cream, tomatoes, and lettuce. 
                    Leave a generous border of tortilla for folding, then fold the edges of tortilla into centre roughly 5-6 times 
                    until the filling is enclosed. Quickly flip your crunch wrap over so the folds are face down and transfer to a baking tray.
                </li>
                <li>Repeat this process 4 more times, then bake your crunch wraps for 5-10 minutes, until crispy and golden.</li>
            </ol>
